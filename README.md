# LucieFlux
**LucieFlux** is a Windows Forms utility to evaluate **beam position stability** from a sequence of measured centroid points `(X, Y)` (optionally with timestamps).
It supports drag-and-drop / paste of text or files containing point data, then computes centroid, azimuth (principal axis), and stability metrics.

## Features
- Drag & drop point data onto the list
- Paste point data via `Ctrl + V`
- Accepts plain numeric text or delimited text (CSV / TSV / semicolon)
- Optional timestamp parsing enables time-window evaluation modes
- Displays :
  - Centroid `(meanX, meanY)`
  - Azimuth (principal axis angle)
  - `ΔX`, `ΔY`, and `Δ`

### v1.0.0.0
#### January 04, 2026
> Initial release.
</details>

### v2.0.0.0
#### January 05, 2026
> Added an Open menu action using `openCSVDialog` with a CSV-only filter (`*.csv`) and multi-select support.
>   
> Loading uses the same parsing flow as file drag-and-drop (`ReadAllText → ParsePointsFromText → AddPoints`).  
>
> Updated file-based loading (drag-and-drop `FileDrop` and Open menu) to clear existing points / ListView items on successful load, keeping only the newly loaded points.  
>
> Kept existing error handling : on load failure, show an error message and leave current data unchanged.  
>
> Updated **Excel export options and worksheet layout** :  
>   - Added `chkOpenBeforeSave` ("Open and edit before saving") to allow opening the generated workbook in Excel without prompting for a save path.  
>   - Excel is shown only after the user dismisses the "Excel export completed" dialog.  
>   - Added `chkExportConsideredOnly` ("Export only considered") to export only the computed considered range instead of the full dataset.  
>     (Main exported Index, Timestamp, X, Y columns respect this selection.)  
>   - Added chart helper columns for the considered range, including an `Index (…)(Considered)` column plus `X (…)(Considered)` / `Y (…)(Considered)` columns.  
>     These are ordered by timestamp when timestamps exist, and the chart uses these helper columns rather than the full dataset.  
>
> Restricted drag-and-drop inputs :  
>   - `lvPoints` now accepts only plain text drops (`DataFormats.Text`) or file drops where all dropped files are `.csv`.  
>   - Other file types are rejected at drag-enter and ignored at drop.

## Required Components & Setup
- Target framework : **.NET Framework 4.8.1**
- Language version : **C# 7.3**

### Initial Setup
- Clone or download the repository.
- Open the solution file (.slnx) in Visual Studio.
- Add necessary references if required.
- Build the project.
- Run the application.
- Add data by drag-and-drop or paste into the list.

## Input formats
Data can be provided as :
- Plain text lines containing at least two numbers (the last two numeric tokens are treated as `X` and `Y`).
- Delimited text with optional header (delimiter auto-detected among `,`, `;`, tab).

### Header / column detection
If a header line is detected, the application attempts to locate :
- Timestamp column : `timestamp`, `time`, `date`
- X column : `x`, `centroid x`
- Y column : `y`, `centroid y`

If columns cannot be detected, the last two columns are treated as `X` and `Y`.

### Timestamp parsing
Timestamp values are optional. When present, the application attempts to parse :

- Time-span format : `mm:ss(.fff...)` or `hh:mm:ss(.fff...)`
- Date-time format : `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss(.fffffff)` or ISO-like `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss(.fffffff)`
- Other common locale formats (best-effort)

Parsed timestamps are converted to microseconds relative to the Unix epoch.

## Evaluation window (Settings)
The application supports two selection strategies :

### Value-based
- **All determined values**
- **Last 1000 values (ISO Standard)**
- **Self-defined number**

### Time-based (enabled only when timestamps exist)
- Short-term Evaluation (1 sec)
- Mid-term Evaluation (1 min)
- Long-term Evaluation (1 hour)
- Self-defined time (seconds)

If timestamps are missing, time-based controls are disabled, and the application falls back to a value-based mode (up to the last 1000 points).

## Computation details
Given the selected subset of points :

1. **Centroid**
   - `meanX = average(X)`
   - `meanY = average(Y)`

2. **Azimuth (principal axis)**
   - Computed from the covariance terms :
     - `azimuthRad = 0.5 * atan2(2 * sxy, (sxx - syy))`

3. **Rotation**
   - Center the points on the centroid and rotate by `-azimuthRad` producing `(x', y')`.

4. **Sample standard deviation**
   - Uses **sample** standard deviation (`n - 1`).

5. **Reported metrics**
   - `ΔX = 4 * σx'`
   - `ΔY = 4 * σy'`
   - `Δ  = 2 * sqrt(2) * sqrt(σx'^2 + σy'^2)`

Angle units can be displayed in radians or degrees.
